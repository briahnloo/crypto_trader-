## 🔍 What to Look For

### ✅ Good Signs (Expected)

**At Startup** (once only):
```
🚨 _load_or_initialize_portfolio CALLED
✅ Portfolio loading guard set
```

**On Each Trade**:
```
🔵 _update_portfolio_with_trade CALLED
💰 CASH_UPDATE: $X → $Y
✅ VERIFICATION: match=True
```

**Equity Calculation**:
```
EQUITY_SNAPSHOT: cash=$4,900, positions=$5,100, total=$10,000
```

### ❌ Bad Signs (Should NOT Appear)

**Duplicate Load Attempt**:
```
❌ DUPLICATE LOAD PREVENTED  ← Would reload stale data
```

**Exception During Trade**:
```
🔴 EXCEPTION in _update_portfolio_with_trade  ← Trade failed
```

**Cash Verification Failure**:
```
CASH_SAVE_FAILED: Expected $9,100, got $10,000  ← Cash not saved
```

**Position Duplication**:
```
🚨 POSITION_DUPLICATION_DETECTED: 2 duplicates  ← Multiple entries
```

---

## 🧪 Verification Steps

### After First Trade
```bash
# 1. Check logs
grep "CASH_UPDATE" logs/crypto_mvp.log | tail -1
# Should show: $10,000 → $9,XXX

# 2. Check database
python diagnose_db.py
# Should show: Discrepancy: $0.00

# 3. Verify equity
grep "EQUITY_SNAPSHOT" logs/crypto_mvp.log | tail -1
# Should show: cash=$9,XXX, positions=$XXX, total=$10,000 (approx)
```

### If Cash Doesn't Deduct

Check which diagnostic marker is MISSING:

```bash
# Should appear for each trade
grep "🔵 _update_portfolio_with_trade" logs/crypto_mvp.log
# If MISSING: Trades bypassing normal flow

# Should NOT appear
grep "🔴 EXCEPTION" logs/crypto_mvp.log
# If PRESENT: Exception preventing cash save

# Should appear once
grep "🚨 _load_or_initialize_portfolio" logs/crypto_mvp.log | wc -l
# If > 1: Multiple loads causing stale data
```

## 🆘 Quick Troubleshooting

### Problem: Cash still shows $10,000 after trade

**Check**:
```bash
grep "🔵 _update_portfolio_with_trade" logs/crypto_mvp.log
```

**If empty**: Trades not going through `_update_portfolio_with_trade`  
**Solution**: Find where trades are created, ensure they call this method

### Problem: Equity keeps inflating

**Check**:
```bash
python diagnose_db.py | grep "Discrepancy"
```

**If not $0.00**: Cash deduction still not working  
**Solution**: Run `python fix_db_cash.py` to correct database

### Problem: Duplicate positions

**Check**:
```bash
sqlite3 trading_state.db "
  SELECT symbol, COUNT(*) 
  FROM positions 
  WHERE session_id='YOUR_SESSION' 
  GROUP BY symbol 
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
"
```

**If results found**: Multiple entries for same symbol  
**Solution**: Position consolidation in code will merge them
